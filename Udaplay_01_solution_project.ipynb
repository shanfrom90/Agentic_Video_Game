That’s why Thrall can wear plate armour even though he’s a shaman, Anduin can both wear plate armour and use a two handed sword despite being a priest etc. Some characters, don’t have their class, represented in game. Like Vol’Jin, he’s a Shadow Hunter or should I say, I thought, he was. After asking on Google, what class he was, the answer I got, from WoWpedia was: Shadow hunter, Shaman, Witch doctor, Priest. She uses a bow and other weapons because NPC privileges (ok actually it’s because priestess of the moon was consolidated into the priest class when they launched WoW but that’s ancient history). Gul’dan - probably flexes all warlock specs to some extent. They used to use melee weapons and ranger.\n",
